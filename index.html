            Apart from the appreciation of the breathtaking details in a gigapixel panorama, panorama of extremely high resolution is known for its practical use. As drones provide flexibility that land panorama cannot achieve, techniques in taking panoramas using drones have been developed. While there are well-developed systems to create reasonably high-resolution sky panorama, creating super-high-resolution panorama using DSLR camera and very zoom-in lens is difficult due to the instability of drone and the weight of DSLR camera and zoom-in lens combined. The heavy load and uncertain wind condition are likely to cause the drone to shake and leave holes in a panorama. A robust system is needed to ensure that no holes are left while the gimbal is controlling the camera to take pictures in different orientations. We propose and implemented a novel system which uses a drone capable of carry heavy load and a smartphone as a wide-angle camera to create sky panorama without holes. The untested user interface reveals that inherited problems exist in the system and further experiments need to be done to increase its flexibility and degree of automation.

            Matching is a ubiquitous resource allocation problem. In many matching problems, each agent (usually a person) has a preference list ranking the other agents. Algorithm is usually employed to find a matching outcome which optimizes a subset of performance metrics. However, the outcomes generated by algorithms may not align well with user tasks. The central planner who do the matching and the agents involved may find it difficult to fully trust the algorithm-generated result as the properties of it can be highly complicated and hence difficult to comprehend. User often wants to explore possible adjustments of the matching which satisfy userâ€™s goal better. Furthermore, an improvement in quality in one area often comes with a compromise in quality in other areas. The current approach using only a few numerical performance metrics for matching comparison precludes a thorough analysis of the trade-offs involved in a matching adjustment. In this report, we address the two issues of how to adjust a matching and how to compare different matching approaches. We analyse the division of tasks between human and algorithm in the process of adjusting a matching to enable a better collaboration between human and machine. Based on the tasks assigned to human, we divide matching adjustment comparison into two levels (i.e. matching-and-matching comparison and change-and-change comparison) and design novel visualization techniques for them. We present a novel line-editing technique for exploring the possible adjustments of a matching outcome. Through our design, users are given the ability to observe the problems in a matching and spatially interact with an algorithm. The algorithm then recommends possible adjustments according to the queries associated with the interaction. Further evaluation of the trade-offs in the adjustments is also supported by our visual analytics system.
